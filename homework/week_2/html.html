    <h2>About Unblight Uniconference</h2>
        <p>Unblight – a national unconference on blight – will bring together community advocates,              technologists, journalists, policymakers and students interested to exchange ideas and              share lessons about combating blight and repurposing abandoned parts of our communities.</p>
    <h3>Why Care?</h3>
        <p> According to Reichert, Macon-Bibb County Mayor, a vacant house soon becomes a vandalized          property that attracts crime, such as drugs and prostitution, and lowers property values            within a quarter mile of the dilapidated property, which impacts sellers, buyers, property          tax revenue and school taxes. </p>
